Abstract 

The problem of collecting responses in multi-hop radio networks is considered. A given node, called the source, is to collect a specified number of 

responses from nodes in a radio network. The problem arises in several 

applications of distributed systems. A deterministic and a randomized protocol for the problem are presented. The two protocols are analyzed and 

their performance is compared. Conclusions are drawn about the suitability 

of our protocols in various network environments.
