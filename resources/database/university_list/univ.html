<STRONG>July, 1996</STRONG>.  This list now has over
<STRONG>3000</STRONG> entries! Several other sites have given special
attention to this site, so they are now listed on a <A
HREF="recognition.html">recognition</A> page. <P>

In response to the increasing amount of email I have been getting, I've
compiled a list of <A HREF="faq.html">frequently asked
questions</A>. <EM>Please read these answers before sending me email!</EM>
<P>

<STRONG>SURVEY:</STRONG>I'm
no longer able to keep up with the survey on 'good school homepages', but
you can see the final <A HREF="results.html">results.</A> Look for an
updated survey within the next couple of months.<P>

These lists contain home pages (please do not send non-http URLs) for
universities and colleges all over the world.  They do not contain
departmental pages unless the page in question did an adequate job of
providing general campus information as well, and the lists only include one
link per school. You can get more information about these lists in the new
<A HREF="faq.html">FAQ</A>.  For a list of US Schools only, see Mike
Conlon's <A
HREF="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/CLAS/american-universities.html">list of
American Universities</A>. <P>

You can now send updates to the lists via <A
HREF="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/cdemello/new-school.html">a
form</A>. If you do not have forms support, please send additions,
corrections, and comments to <EM><A
HREF="mailto:cdemello@mit.edu">cdemello@mit.edu</A></EM>.  Please allow some
time for a response as I no longer have a direct net connection at work
every day. Also, this list may be updated more quickly than I can respond
personally to email.<P>
