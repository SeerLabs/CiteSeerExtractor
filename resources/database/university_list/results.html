Results</H1>

July, 1996.  The top fifteen schools are listed below and each has
received at least 15 votes.  Schools with the most votes are listed first.
I am temporarily unable to take additional nominations, but look for a new
survey within the next couple of months.  You may also want to take a look
at a <A

class project</A> done at Columbia University's Teachers College which
surveyed over 450 school home pages.  <P>
